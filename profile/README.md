## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ This organization is intended to be for unofficial extensions for [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) and [System.Text.Json](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json?view=net-7.0).

🌈 Contribution guidelines - in order to contribute just create a pull request or ask to be added to the organization (as it is intended to mostly hold libraries). Please be kind.

🍿 Fun facts - These libraries are intended to be suitable for use from C# or VB.net programming languages. This is in contrast to for instance [Fleece](https://github.com/fsprojects/Fleece) that is intended for F#!
